Dan met with Tara Whalen and discussed the 2026 policy/regulatory Priority. AB members may
be asked to participate in that discussion, and Dan will follow-up
next week with the virtual face-to-face.

Brent was also invited to join the Structural Evolution Task Force.

## Read out of the Sep 16 AB-Led Member Meeting

The AB agreed that we should open up the AB-led member meeting to the
wider member community. Angel will have a conversation with MarComm
Team.

The Vision TF will pause additional work on the Vision so that we can
see how the vision interacts with the work of the W3C before working on
future edits.

## Agenda for AB Meetings on Sep 22, 23 and 24

Each day will have two sessions with a 10-minute break in between. Each
session focuses on one Priority,
and by the end of the session, there will be actions, agreed consensus
points on a topic, plans, etc.

Elena and Dan will meet to discuss the Writing Strategy position
statements as a prelude to that discussion next week.
