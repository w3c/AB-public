##  Info Share
Elena noted that the 2025 Membership Survey is live
and encouraged AB members to both take the survey and share it with
their colleagues. The AB discussed meeting with the Board of Directors
to speak about the AB Liaison position, and ultimately decided that 
they would continue to review a document with the AB's feedback for the 
Board on the position.

## Sep AB Working Week Planning
The AB is planning a "working week" the week of September 22nd. This
will consist of three video calls across three days with a focus on getting
work done.

The agenda will be largely focused on the above priorities.

We also noted that the membership should be informed in the
upcoming AB-led member meeting that the AB intends to put the Vision on
the back burner.

We also discussed how we can clean up our GitHub repo issue list and make
it the basis for our future work and agenda planning. Angel and Dan agreed
to do some initial
triage of issues raised in various AB GitHub repositories and pages, but
the AB as a whole will have a working session where they go through all
the issues together.

## Sep 16 AB-led Member Meeting
The AB discussed the agenda of the upcoming AB-led member meeting and
