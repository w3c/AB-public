# W3C Vision: An Emphasis on Values

## Status of this Document
This document is an articulation 
of the W3C’s mission, values, purpose, and principles;
in other words, our vision for W3C as an organization 
in the context of our vision for the Web itself. 
The goal of this vision is not to predict the future, 
but to define shared principles to guide our decisions.

This document is not intended to be 
an operational strategy for W3C Inc. as an organization: 
such a strategy should take this Vision into account, 
but it is not the Vision itself.

This document should not provide recommendations 
for or against specific technologies: 
technologies are not value neutral, 
and preference for or against particular technologies 
should be influenced by values as articulated here, 
but this Vision should be a guide for thinking about such things, 
rather than contain specific answers.

The goal of this document is to:

* Help the world understand what W3C is, what it does, and why it matters.
* Be opinionated enough to provide a helpful framework when making decisions, 
  particularly on controversial issues.
* Be grounded enough in the shared values of the W3C community 
  to represent the emergent consensus of most of our participants.
* Be timeless enough that it does not need frequent revision.

## Introduction
The World Wide Web was originally conceived 
as a tool for sharing information. 
It has evolved into a fundamental part of humanity, 
providing access to knowledge, education, 
commerce and shopping, social experiences, 
civic functions, entertainment, and more.

The Web has been a force for good, 
and has sparked major social changes. 
But the Web's amazing success 
has led to many unintended consequences 
that harm society: 
openness and anonymity have given rise to scams, phishing, and fraud; 
the ease of gathering personal information has led to business models 
that mine and sell detailed user data, 
without people's awareness or consent; 
rapid global information sharing 
has allowed misinformation to flourish and be exploited 
for political or commercial gain.  
This has divided societies and incited hate. 
We must do better. 
We must take steps to address these consequences 
in the standards we create.

Technology is not neutral; 
new technologies enable new actions and new possibilities. 
We are proud of the good the Web has enabled; 
we must take the responsibility to use our values 
to address the actual impact of our work. 

Our vision is for a World Wide Web that is more inclusive, 
and more respectful of its users: 
a Web that supports truth over falsehood, 
people over profits,
humanity over hate.

We will improve the ethical integrity of the Web. 
As the Web continues to grow in importance 
to include all humanity as its users,
it must increase its respect for those users
and the trust it earns from them.

# Vision for the World Wide Web

* The Web is for [all humanity](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#allpeople).
* The Web is designed for the [good of its users](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#noharm).
* The Web must be [safe for its users](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#privacy).
* There is [one interoperable world-wide Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#oneweb).

# Vision for W3C

The fundamental purpose of the W3C is to provide an open forum 
where diverse voices from around the world
and from different organizations and industries
work together to build consensus
on voluntary global standards for Web technologies. 

* We put the needs of users first: 
	above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity.
* This organization believes in diversity
	and inclusion of participants from different
	geographical locations, 
	cultures,
	languages,
	disabilities, 
	gender identities,
	and more. 
* We believe in principled, community-wide consensus-building 
	as the basis for building standards.
* We strongly emphasize accessibility, 
	internationalization, 
	privacy,
	and security.
* We believe the Web must be an environmentally sustainable platform, 
	as defined [in the Ethical Web Principles] (https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#sustainable).
* Our standards are rooted in a strong royalty-free patent policy 
	and open copyright licenses, 
	openly developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders.
* We welcome individuals and organizations of all sizes 
	(from single-person companies to multi-nationals),
	and take feedback from the general public.


# Principles and Values

As W3C leads the Web forward, 
our mission is to recognize and embody fundamental values and principles 
into the architecture of the Web. 
We must become more principled in our execution of the vision of the Web.
We must
* Ensure the Web is trustworthy, 
	by ensuring security and privacy for users. 
* Aim to reduce centralization in Web architecture,
	minimizing single points of failure 
	and single points of control.
* Remain focused on ensuring reliable interoperability 
	through implementation experience
	and open test suites.
* Implement a unified, extensible, Web architecture, 
	which continues to address evolving use cases for the general public.

We will do this by:
* Encouraging incubation in new areas and industries 
	with open platforms for discussion, collaboration, and innovation, 
	making it more structured 
	and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.
* Striving for the broadest participation, 
	along axes including worldwide participation, diversity, and inclusion, 
	facilitating balance, equity, and cooperation 
	among the participants from different industries, 
	user groups, and organizational sizes, 
	and thus establishing W3C as representative of the whole community.
* Increasing involvement of under-represented key stakeholders 
	such as end users, content creators, and developers.
* Ensuring transparency, equity, and fairness. 
	Our work will not be exclusively dominated 
	by any person, company, or interest group.
* Ensuring the Web platform meets goals in horizontal principles such as 
	accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and sustainability.
* Establishing and improving collaborative relationships 
	with other organizations in the domain of Internet and Web standards, 
	including building and maintaining respected relationships 
	with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.
