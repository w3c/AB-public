# The W3C Vision: An Emphasis on Values

## Introduction
The World Wide Web was conceived more than 25 years ago 
as a tool for sharing information. 
It has become much more than that; 
it is a fundamental part of the lives of much of humanity, 
enabling access to information, education, 
commerce and shopping, social experiences, 
civic functions, entertainment, and more. 

The Web is a force for good; 
indeed, it has catalyzed major social changes. 
At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success 
has led to many unintended consequences 
that inflict significant distress on society: 
openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud. 
Ease of gathering personal information spawned business models 
that mined and sold detailed user behaviors, 
without people’s awareness or consent. 
The acceleration of global information sharing 
enabled misinformation to flourish, 
to be exploited for political or commercial gain, 
divide societies,
and to incite hate. 
We must do better. 
We must take steps to address these unintended consequences 
in the standards we develop.

Technology is not neutral; 
new technologies facilitate new actions, and enable new possibilities. 
We are proud of the good enabled by our web technologies; 
we will take the responsibility to use our values 
both to assess the potential and actual impact of our work 
(especially harms caused by that work), 
and to optimize these technologies throughout their lifecycles.

Our vision is for a World Wide Web that is more inclusive, 
and more respectful of its users: 
a Web that supports truth better than falsehood, 
people more than profits,
humanity rather than hate.

We will improve the fundamental integrity of the Web platform. 
The Web will not only grow in scope and importance in our lives; 
it will grow in respect for its users, 
grow in the trust of its users, 
and grow in its inclusion of all humanity as its users.

# Vision for the World-Wide Web

* The Web is for all humanity.
* The Web is designed for the good of its users.
* The Web must be safe for its users.
* There is one interoperable world-wide Web.

# Vision for the W3C

The W3C is an association where diverse voices 
from around the world and industries come together 
to incubate and build consensus 
for global standards that make up the Web, 
serving the Vision for the Web.

* We put the needs of users first: 
	above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity.
* This organization believes in diversity
	and inclusion of participants from different
	geographical locations, 
	cultures,
	languages,
	accessibility needs, 
	gender identities,
	and more. 
* We believe in principled, community-wide consensus-building 
	as the basis for building standards.
* We strongly emphasize accessibility, 
	internationalization, 
	privacy,
	and security.
* Our standards are rooted in a strong royalty-free patent policy 
	and open copyright licenses, 
	openly developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders.

# Mission of the W3C
The fundamental purpose of the W3C is to provide an open forum 
where diverse voices from around the world
and from different industries
work together to build consensus
on global standards for Web technologies. 
This forum welcomes individuals and organizations of all sizes 
(from single-person companies to multi-nationals),
and takes into active consideration
feedback from the general public.

As the W3C leads the Web forward, 
our mission is to recognize and embody fundamental values and principles 
into the architecture of the web. 
We must become more principled in our execution of the vision of the Web.

# Principles and Values

We must
* Ensure the Web is trustworthy, 
	by ensuring security and privacy for users. 
* Aim to reduce centralization in web architecture,
	minimizing single points of failure 
	and single points of control.
* Remain focused on interoperability and collective empowerment, 
	and ensure our work is supported by open test suites.
* Implement a unified, extensible, Web architecture, 
	which continues to address evolving use cases for the general public.

We will do this by:
* Encouraging incubation in new areas and industries 
	with open platforms for discussion, collaboration, and innovation, 
	making it more structured 
	and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.
* Striving for the broadest participation, 
	along axes including worldwide participation, diversity, and inclusion, 
	facilitating balance, equity, and cooperation 
	among the participants from different industries, 
	user groups, and organizational sizes, 
	and thus establishing W3C as representative of the whole community.
* Increasing involvement of under-represented key stakeholders 
	such as end users, content creators, and developers.
* Ensuring transparency, equity, and fairness. 
	Our work will not be exclusively dominated 
	by any person, company, or interest group.
* Establishing and improving collaborative relationships 
	with other organizations in the domain of Internet and Web standards, 
	including building and maintaining respected relationships 
	with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.
