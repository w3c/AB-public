# The Mission of the W3C

The W3C leads the community in defining a World Wide Web that is inclusive and respectful of its users, 
to empower an ethical, equitable, informed, and interconnected society.

## **Introduction**
### The World Wide Web

The World Wide Web was originally conceived as a tool for sharing information. 
It has evolved rapidly into a fundamental part of humanity, 
sparking major social change by providing access to 
knowledge, education, commerce and shopping, social experiences, civic functions, entertainment, and more.

The Web's amazing success has also led to many unintended consequences that harm society: 
openness and anonymity have given rise to scams, phishing, and fraud. 
The ease of gathering personal information has led to business models that mine and sell detailed user data, without people's awareness or consent. 
Rapid global information sharing has allowed misinformation to flourish and be exploited for political and commercial gain. 
Technology is not neutral; 
new technologies enable new actions and new possibilities, and we must take responsibility to address the impacts of the Web.

We believe the World Wide Web should be inclusive and respectful of its users: 
a Web that supports truth over falsehood, people over profits, humanity over hate. 
The W3C’s Technical Architecture Group's work to clearly define [Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/) 
is a strong basis to improve the ethical integrity of the Web. 
The Web has had a tremendous impact on the world, and will continue to grow its impact in the future, 
by expanding reach, knowledge, education and services even more broadly.

### The W3C

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded as an organization to provide a consistent architecture across the rapid pace of progress in the Web, 
and to build a common community to support its development. 
It has become an association where diverse voices from around the world and industries work together to evolve the Web.

To build a better future, the W3C must rise even further to the challenge of improving the Web's fundamental integrity, 
while continuing to expand the Web’s scope and reach. 
We must embody in our work the core values of the Web itself, 
by supporting the Ethical Web Principles with Operational Principles of the W3C.

The W3C’s impact will be clearly demonstrated by how it leads the Web forward: 
by being inclusive, principled, and continually striving to make the Web better through these principles and the Ethical Web Principles. 
As the Ethical Web Principles state, “The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society.”

## Operational Principles of the W3C

* The W3C intentionally involves stakeholders from end to end in building the Web: developers, content creators, and end users.
  Our work will not be dominated by any person, company, or interest group, but uses consensus from the community
  to put the needs of users first: above authors, publishers, and implementers.
* We believe in the diversity of the Web, and its inclusion of participants
  from different geographical locations, cultures, languages, disabilities, gender identities, industries, user groups, organizational sizes, and more.
  In addition to ensuring the W3C serves the needs of the entire Web user base,
  we must also strive to broaden diversity and inclusion for our own participants.
* We strive to create standards with an ethical intent to improve equity of access and participation on the Web.
  We will ensure the web platform meets broad goals using consistent horizontal review
  to ensure accessibility, internationalization, security, privacy, and sustainability.
* We believe standards should be widely and interoperably implemented.
  To ensure reliable interoperability, we require implementation experience and open test suites for our standards.
* The Web will continue to expand in user base, global reach, and technical breadth.
  We are committed to encouraging incubation in new areas, collaborating on new innovations across our community.
* We exclusively create open royalty-free standards.
  Our process is rooted in open development, strong royalty-free patent policy and open copyright licenses.
* The W3C is committed to collaborative relationships with other Internet and Web standards organizations,
  including building and maintaining respected relationships with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.
